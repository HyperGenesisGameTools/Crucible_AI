### **SMEAC: Operation COGNITIVE SHIELD (v2.0)**

---

#### **1. (S) Situation**

**General:** This operation initiates the evolution of the Crucible AI project from a proof-of-concept local agent (V0.1) into a networked, user-centric personal assistant (V0.2). The operational environment expands from a single local machine to include the Discord platform, introducing network interactions and asynchronous communication.

**Adversary Forces:** The primary adversary remains the 48-hour time limit. Secondary adversaries have evolved and now include the complexities of asynchronous programming required for a Discord bot, potential network latency, API rate limits, and the challenge of designing and managing a more sophisticated, stateful memory system.

**Friendly Forces:** The operational team consists of ARCHITECT (sole developer) and GEMINI (AI Co-Developer). The team is strengthened by the successful completion of the first crucible, a proven collaborative workflow, and the stable V0.1 codebase which serves as a foundational asset.

**Attachments/Detachments:** None. This is a self-contained operation.

#### **2. (M) Mission**

ARCHITECT, supported by GEMINI, will design, build, test, and document **Cognitive Shield (V0.2)** within a 48-hour period, commencing upon receipt of this order. The resulting agent will be a Discord-based personal assistant designed for cognitive offloading, capable of managing user tasks, lists, and reminders. It will feature a multi-component memory system for contextual conversation and implement an asynchronous Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) protocol for all database-modifying actions. The purpose is to produce a functional V0.2 prototype that provides tangible daily utility and validates a more advanced, networked agent architecture.

#### **3. (E) Execution**

**a. Commander's Intent:** The intent is to produce a *useful* and *functional* prototype. The focus shifts from pure speed of development to the successful implementation of key user-centric features. The end state is an agent that can be reliably tasked via Discord to help a busy individual manage their daily cognitive load. The principle "Useful is better than perfect" will guide all decisions.

**b. Concept of Operations (CONOPS):** This operation will be conducted in four phases, executed sequentially over the 48-hour period. The phases are designed to build upon each other, starting with establishing the new interface and culminating in a field-tested, documented agent.
* **Phase I: The Bridge (Day 1: Hours 0-10):** Establish the agent's presence on Discord.
* **Phase II: The Mind's Eye (Day 1: Hours 10-24):** Engineer the new memory architecture.
* **Phase III: The Helping Hand (Day 2: Hours 24-40):** Build the core user-assistance tools.
* **Phase IV: Field Test & Polish (Day 2: Hours 40-48):** Ensure stability and document the result.

**c. Scheme of Maneuver:**

* **Block I: Discord Beachhead (Hours 0-3):** Establish a persistent connection to Discord, confirming basic two-way communication.
* **Block II: Porting the Agent (Hours 3-10):** Integrate the V0.1 agent's core logic into the Discord bot, making its existing knowledge base available.
* **Block III: Memory Architecture (Hours 10-24):** Design and implement the three-part memory system (Short-Term Prompt Context, Long-Term Vector DB, and the Memory Manager process).
* **Block IV: Asynchronous HITL & New Tools (Hours 24-40):** Implement the emoji-based approval flow for actions and create the new tools for list and reminder management.
* **Block V: Integration & Documentation (Hours 40-48):** Conduct end-to-end testing of all features and produce a comprehensive `README_V0.2.md` file.

**d. Coordinating Instructions:**

* **Local-First Principle (v2.0):** The core agent logic, database, and vector store will remain on the user's local machine. The Discord bot acts as a remote interface to this user-owned and controlled instance.
* **Asynchronous Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** All agent actions that modify the database *must* use the asynchronous confirmation protocol (e.g., emoji reactions). Direct, unconfirmed writes are prohibited.
* **Phase Completion:** A phase is considered complete only after the milestone for its final module is successfully tested and verified as per the "Operation: Cognitive Shield" development plan.

#### **4. (A) Administration & Logistics**

**Administration:** Developer (ARCHITECT) is responsible for their own work/rest cycle and sustenance throughout the 48-hour operation.

**Logistics:** Ensure the following resources ("The Arsenal") are staged and ready prior to H-Hour:
* **Hardware:** A development machine with a minimum of 16GB RAM. A GPU is recommended.
* **Software (Pre-installed/Downloaded):**
  * Python 3.10+
  * LM Studio (running and accessible).
  * All packages from V0.1 `requirements.txt`.
  * **New:** `discord.py` library.
  * A properly configured `.env` file for storing secrets.
* **Accounts & Keys:**
  * A functional Google Account for collaboration with GEMINI.
  * A Discord account with access to the Developer Portal.
  * A new Discord Application with a Bot User created.
  * The Bot Token, safely stored in the `.env` file.
* **Assets:**
  * The complete, functional V0.1 project code.
  * The existing `project_tasks.db` SQLite database.
  * The existing `chroma_db/` vector store.
  * A pre-downloaded GGUF-compatible model loaded in LM Studio.

#### **5. (C) Command & Signal**

**Command:**
* ARCHITECT is the operation commander and holds final decision-making authority on all implementation details.
* GEMINI serves as the primary support and advisory element, tasked with accelerating development through code generation, strategic planning, and debugging.

**Signal (Communications Plan):**
* **Primary Command Channel:** Developer's direct interaction with the IDE and terminal.
* **Primary User Interface Channel:** The Discord client.
* **Primary Support Channel:** The Gemini web interface.
* **Comms Discipline:** The practice of using separate, specialized chat threads with GEMINI for distinct operational tasks (e.g., "Discord Bot Logic," "Memory System Design") will be maintained to prevent context bleed.
* **Mission Completion Signal:** The operation is concluded upon the successful completion and commit of the `README_V0.2.md` file and a demonstration of the agent running stably in Discord.
